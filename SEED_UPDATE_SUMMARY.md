## Data Distribution Summary

| Month | Users | Partners | Categories | Subcategories | Items | User Orders | Partner Orders |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Jan   | 2     | 0        | 1          | 1             | 1     | 1           | 0              |

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Default View (No Date Filter)
- Should show data from January to April 2024
- All months should have data points
- Trends should show gradual growth

### 2. Custom Date Range: January Only
- Should show data for January 2024 only
- 2 users, 1 category, 1 subcategory, 1 item, 1 order

### 3. Custom Date Range: Q1 2024 (Jan-Mar)
- Should show data for January to March 2024
- 4 users, 3 categories, 5 subcategories, 4 items, 3 orders

### 4. Custom Date Range: Last 2 Months
- Should show data for March to April 2024
- 2 users, 2 categories, 3 subcategories, 2 items, 2 orders

## Notes for Developers

### 1. Database Reset
- Running this seed will drop the existing database
- All data will be replaced with the new sample data
- Ensure no production data is in the database before running

### 2. Date Consistency
- All dates are set to 2024 for consistency
- This ensures the data works well with the current year logic
- Future updates may need to adjust dates dynamically

### 3. Model Compatibility
- All models now support `timestamps: true`
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields are automatically managed
- No manual timestamp management required

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Seed
```bash
cd NanocartBackend
node seed.js
```

### 2. Verify API Endpoints
- Test all monthly trends endpoints
- Verify date range filtering works
- Check that trends data is realistic

### 3. Frontend Integration
- The frontend is already prepared for this data
- Date range filters should work immediately
- Charts should display meaningful trends

**Status:** ✅ Seed file updated and ready for testing
**Compatibility:** Works with all updated models and new API endpoints
**Data Quality:** Realistic, staggered data for meaningful trends visualization
